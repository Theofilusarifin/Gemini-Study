Line Chart: Use when visualizing the trajectory of a single continuous variable over time. Ideal for showcasing trends and patterns in time-series data.
Grouped Line Chart: Prefer when comparing the trends of multiple continuous variables over time. Helpful for comparative analysis of trends between different groups.
Bar Chart: Opt for discrete data sets where clear comparisons between distinct categories are necessary. Useful for displaying categorical data with individual bars representing each category.
Grouped Bar Chart: Choose when comparing multiple categories across different groups, especially when additional categorical variables can be represented using different colors or patterns.
Stacked Bar Chart: Use to illustrate the composition of a whole across different categories, where the emphasis is on the relative proportions of each category within the whole.
Pie Chart: Prefer for visualizing the proportion of different categories within a whole, particularly when the number of categories is relatively small and easily distinguishable.
Scatter Plot: Opt for exploring relationships between two continuous variables, suitable for identifying patterns, correlations, or outliers in the data.
Grouped Scatter Plot: Choose when comparing relationships between variables across different datasets on a single plot, facilitating multi-dimensional analysis and comparison.
Histogram: Prefer when visualizing the distribution of a single continuous variable through bins and bar heights, aiding in understanding data distribution patterns.
Box Plot: Use for providing a comprehensive view of a variable's distribution, including quartiles, outliers, and median, particularly effective for comparing distributions across different groups.
Grouped Box Plot: Choose when comparing distributions of multiple variables through box-and-whisker plots on the same chart, facilitating comparative analysis between groups.
Area Chart: Opt for visualizing trends over time, especially when emphasizing the magnitude of change over time by filling the area under the line.
Waterfall Chart: Use to demonstrate the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values in a series, effectively visualizing incremental changes over time or across categories.
